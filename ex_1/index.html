	<h1>New Breath on Calligraphy</h1>
	<h2>eL Seed's jounrey to calligraffiti</h2>


	<p class="bigger"> eL Seed was born and raised in suburban Paris to Tunisian parents. He started spraypainting in the 90s, as form of self-exploration of his multiple identities and heritage. With hip-hop, graffiti and Arabic calligraphy as his focal interests, it is perhaps no surprise that these culminated in the creation of calligraffiti: street art that blends graffiti techniques and Arabic calligraphy. <br> Having given a recent TEDtalk (see below) on the positive potential of street art, he is acutely aware of the impact that art can have for social change. While his calligraffiti pieces are visually remarkable, they also always feature a phrase, a few lines of poetry or a meaningful quote aimed to make a social impact. For example, in 2011 he painted a calligraffiti stating “This is just a phrase in Arabic” in Arabic in Los Angeles. This piece intended for viewers to challenge their own negative perceptions and associations of Islam with extremism. </p>
