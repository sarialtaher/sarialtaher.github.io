    	  				<p id="panel">Street art is relatively new in this North African country. But over the past few years, more and more colorful pieces of graffiti, “calligraffiti”—a hybrid of Arabic calligraphy and graffiti—and other forms of art have started to appear on the walls of cafes and schools, alongside roads, and even on the domes of mosques. Young street artists aim to brighten up the suburbs and at the same time deliver a message.<br>

    	  			<p id="caption2">Belal Khaled at work on the “Besieged Childhood” mural in November 2015.</p>
    	  			<p id="panel2">Sit was from a desire to convey Gaza’s suffering that the “Besieged Childhood” mural was born, and it was also a “message,” said Khaled, that artists will not be silenced. “Gaza may be besieged, but it has artists who are capable of absorbing what is happening in Palestine and conveying this to the outside world in different, creative ways,” said Khaled.

    	  					<p id="panel3">Yazan Halwani is a young Beiruti artist who paints murals of revered Lebanese and Arab figures on prominent walls in a bid to help overcome sectarianism in this fragmented city. “What I try to do,” he explains down a fuzzy line from Beirut, “is write the stories of the city, on its own walls – creating a memory for the city.”<br>
